# 🌋 Inside the Volcano – First Python Project
*“Every coder starts with spaghetti.”*

This was the **first Python project I ever built** — a text-based adventure game where the player is forced into the mouth of a volcano, but he/she discovere that there's a whole new world underneath! 

This version was initially made in late June 2025,
At the time, my knowledge of Python was limited to:
- `print` statements  
- `if-elif-else` conditionals  

I didn’t even know how to use GitHub back then 😅, so this version is being uploaded now as a record of my early journey.

## ⚠️ Current State
This version of the game is **unfinished**, but it already contains a sizeable portion of the branching story.  
Some missing parts include:
1. Elara’s full path  
2. The complete story (it currently ends on a cliffhanger)  
3. Proper modularization and code structure

## 🛠️ What Comes Next
I’m currently on **Week 8 of Harvard’s CS50P**. And am currently in the process of learning more advanced concepts like:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- File I/O  
- Modular code design  

…I plan to **rebuild the game** in a cleaner, more scalable version.  
That next version will either live in a new repository or be added here as an upgraded edition. Stay tuned! 🚀

## 🙌 Feedback
Any feedback, suggestions, or even just words of encouragement are always appreciated.  
This is just the beginning of my coding journey, and I’m excited to see how far it will go!
